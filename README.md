# Number Guessing Game

Using Python, I coded a game that allows the player to keep guessing a generated random number within a defined range.
- If the player doesn't win, they get another go
- If the player wins, they'll read "You win! and the game ends"

## How to Open the Game to Play

1. Download the python file *number-guessing-game.py* and copy the file path (by opening it in your text editor, going to *Edit*, then clicking *copy path*)
2. Open your commandline/terminal
3. type <code>python</code>, add a space and paste the file path. Then press enter.
4. Start playing!

### Tips
- Type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to kill the game
- For testing purposes, in the python file, uncomment line 5 <code>print random_number</code> to see the randomly generated number
