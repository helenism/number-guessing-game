# Number Guessing Game

Using Python, I coded a game that allows the player to keep guessing a generated random number within a defined range.
- If the player doesn't win, they get another go
- If the player wins, they'll read "You win! and the game ends"

### Tips
- Type <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> to kill the game
- For testing purposes, uncomment line 5 <code>print random_number</code> to see the randomly generated number
